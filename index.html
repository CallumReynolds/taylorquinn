											<h2>Hi there!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Taylor and I have just graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and Education from The University of Queensland. My teaching areas are English and Drama at a high school level. I have attended placement at Bundamba State Secondary College, Marsden State High School, Yeronga State High School, and Indooroopilly State High School. Each of these opportunities taught me a lot and I am excited to put my practice and theory to good use in the classroom! I am currently looking for a teaching position and am so excited for the year ahead as I begin my teaching career.</p>
